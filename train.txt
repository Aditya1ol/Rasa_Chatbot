12) in the Special Round, as your rank matches the cutoff.
question: As a Defence quota student, what is the rank difference between the most
and least competitive branches?	The most competitive branch is Computer Science and Engineering
(min: 2), and the least competitive is Biotechnology (max: 112). The difference
is 112 - 2 = 110.
question: As a PwD student, should I be concerned if my rank is close to the minimum
rank for Computer Science and Engineering?	Yes, if your rank is close to 998050 (e.g., 999000), you should be
cautious. The min/max rank being the same (998050) suggests it might be a
single seat, so competition could be high, and you might miss out if that seat is
taken.
question: What is the basic eligibility for B.E. at PU?	A candidate must have passed 10+2 with Physics and Mathematics
as compulsory subjects, along with Chemistry/Biology/Biotechnology/Technical
subject. Additionally, they must appear in JEE (Main) for the current admission
year.

nology (min: 68, max: 112), Computer Science and Engineering (min: 2, max:
8), Electrical and Electronics Engineering (min: 45, max: 47), Electronics and
Communication Engineering (min: 24, max: 32), Information Technology (min:
15, max: 23), Mechanical Engineering (min: 51, max: 57).
question: Im a Defence quota student with a rank of 1. How many branches can I
apply for?	With a rank of 1, you can apply for: Computer Science and Engineering
(min: 2, max: 8). No other branches are available, as their minimum ranks are
higher (e.g., Information Technology at 15).
question: As a PwD student, what does it mean if the minimum and maximum ranks
are the same for a branch?	If the minimum and maximum ranks are the same (e.g., 998050 for
Computer Science and Engineering), it likely means only one PwD candidate
was allotted a seat in that branch, or it reﬂects a speciﬁc allotment case under
the All India Quota.
question: Do spot round admissions have different rules?	Yes, spot rounds typically allow candidates who havent been allotted
in earlier rounds or are seeking upgrades. Usually, there’s no withdrawal/refund
after spot admission.
question: Do cutoff ranks increase or decrease in spot rounds?	Cutoff ranks usually increase (become less competitive) in spot rounds
because many top-ranked students have already taken seats elsewhere.
question: Are Integrated B.E.-MBA courses available?	Yes, UIET Chandigarh offers an Integrated B.E.-MBA dual degree pro-
gram in select branches.
question: As a PwD student, can I expect to get a seat in the Spot Round with a rank
of 1160000?	No, with a rank of 1160000, you wont qualify for any branch, as the
highest maximum rank is 1154312 (Information Technology). The Spot Round
might not help unless new seats are added, which is unlikely.

quota. Eligibility certiﬁcate and relevant documents are required from the Dean
International Students.
question: What is the least competitive branch for SC students based on this table?	The least competitive branch is Biotechnology, as it has the highest
maximum rank (388856), meaning it accepts students with lower ranks com-
pared to other branches.
question: As an EWS student, what is the rank difference between the most and least
competitive branches?	The most competitive branch is Computer Science and Engineering
(min: 5423), and the least competitive is Biotechnology (max: 193410). The
difference is 193410 - 5423 = 187,987.

(min: 58714, max: 67113) in the Special Round, as your rank is within the range.
question: Are these closing ranks different for state quota?	Yes, State Quota usually has different (and often more lenient) cutoffs
than the All India Quota.
question: What is the intake capacity in B.E. programs?	Intake ranges from 60 to 120 students per branch depending on the
institute and stream.
question: Im a Sports quota student with a rank of 50. Can I get into any branch?	No, with a rank of 50, you cannot get into any branch, as the highest

Engineering tell me about my chances?	The rank range for Electrical and Electronics Engineering is 147993 to
149895. If your rank is within this range, you have a good chance of securing a
seat, but if its closer to the maximum (e.g., 149000), you should be cautious as
seats may ﬁll up quickly.
question: Im a Sports quota candidate. Can I get into Electronics and Communication
Engineering with a rank of 15?
21	Yes, with a rank of 15, you can get into Electronics and Communication
Engineering, as your rank is better than the cutoff (min/max: 18).
question: As a Sports quota student, what is the rank difference between the most
and least competitive branches?	The most competitive branch is Computer Science and Engineering
(min: 7), and the least competitive is Biotechnology (max: 43). The difference is
43 - 7 = 36.
question: As an SC student, should I be worried if my rank is close to the maximum
rank for a branch?	If your rank is close to the maximum rank (e.g., 270000 for Electrical
and Electronics Engineering with a max of 271802), theres some risk. Seats
may ﬁll up quickly, especially in earlier rounds. You might have a better chance
in later rounds like the Spot Round if seats remain.

ence and Engineering (min: 315588), Information Technology (min: 431211).
Thats 2 branches.
question: Why are there no ranks listed for most branches for PwD students?	The absence of ranks for branches like Biotechnology, Electrical and
Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, and Me-
chanical Engineering likely means no PwD candidates were allotted seats in
these branches under the All India Quota, possibly due to limited seats, low pref-
erence, or no PwD applicants meeting eligibility criteria.
