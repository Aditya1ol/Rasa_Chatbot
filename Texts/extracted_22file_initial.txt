an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience ,subject to fulfilling minimum 
requirements for continuation. 
 
 
2.2 
Performance/progress of a student is measured by the number of credits that 
he/she has earned ( completed satisfactorily). Based on the course credits and grades 
obtained by the student, grade point average is calculated. A minimum grade point 
average is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress and continuation in the 
programme. Also a minimum number of earned credits and a minimum grade point 
average should be acquired in order to qualify for the degree. 
 
2.3 
Course Credit Assignment: 
 
Each course has a certain number of credits assigned to it depending on the associated 
number of lecture , tutorials and laboratory contact hours in a week. A few courses are

2.4 
Earning Credits : 
 
At the end of every course, a letter grade is awarded in each course for which a student 
had registered. On obtaining a pass grade (  at least ‘D’ grade), the student accumulates 
the course credits as earned credits. Performance of a student is measured by the 
number of credits that he/she has earned and by the weighted grade point average. A 
student has the option of auditing some courses. Grades obtained in these audit courses 
are not counted towards the calculation of grade point average. However, a pass grade 
(‘D’  grade ) is essential for earning credits from an audit course.

Evaluation of Performance : 
5.1 
The performance of a student shall be evaluated in terms of two indices , 
viz. Semester Grade Point Average ( SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average ( 
CGPA). 
 
SGPA is the grade point average for the semester, and CGPA is the cumulative grade 
point average for all the completed semesters at any point in time. 
 
The earned credits (E.C) are defined as the sum of course credits for course in which 
A+  to D grade has been obtained. For U.G students  (B.E) , credits from courses in 
which NP or S grade has been obtained are also added. 
 
Points earned in a semester =  
  
The SGPA is calculated on the basis of grades obtained in all courses, except audit 
courses and courses in which S/Z grade is awarded, registered for the particular 
semester.
