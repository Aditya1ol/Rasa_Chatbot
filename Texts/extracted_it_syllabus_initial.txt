EXAMINATION NOTE: 
The Semester question paper of a subject will be of 50 marks having 7 questions of equal marks. First question, 
covering the whole syllabus and having questions of conceptual nature, will be compulsory. Rest of the paper will 
be divided into two sections having three questions each and the candidate is required to attempt at least two 
questions from each section.

Credit System  
 
2.1 All B.E programmes are organized around semester-based credit system of study. The credit 
system is based on continuous evaluation of a student’s performance/progress and includes flexibility 
to allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to 
fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. 
 
2.2 Performance/progress of a student is measured by the number of credits that he/she has earned 
(completed satisfactorily). Based on the course credits and grades obtained by the student, grade point 
average is calculated, subject to his qualification of minimum grade in each subject.  
 
2.3 Course Credit Assignment: 
Each course has a certain number of credits assigned to it depending on the associated number of 
lecture, tutorials and laboratory contact hours in a week. A few courses are without credit and are 
referred to as non-credit (NC) courses.                                                                                                
Lectures and Tutorials: One lecture hour or one tutorial hour per week per semester is assigned one 
credit. 
Practical / Laboratory Work: One laboratory hour per week per semester is assigned half credit. 
The credits are rounded off to the nearest whole number. 
For each lecture or tutorial the self study component is 1 hour/week 
 
2.4 
Earning Credits : 
At the end of every course, a letter grade is awarded in each course for which a student has registered. 
On obtaining a pass grade (at least ‘D’ grade), the student accumulates the course credits as earned 
credits. Performance of a student is measured by the number of credits that he/she has earned and by 
the weighted grade point average.  Grades obtained in audit courses are not counted towards the 
calculation of grade point average. However, a pass grade (‘D’ grade) is essential for earning credits 
from an audit course.

4.0 Evaluation System 
 
4.1 Continuous Assessment: 
 
There shall be continuous evaluation of the student during the semester. For evaluation purpose, total 
marks assigned to each subject shall be distributed as : 
Two Mid semester Examination (Minor-1 and Minor-2) with 30 % of total marks assigned to the 
subject. Best Marks of one of these two will be considered for award of sessional. 
 
Assignments/Class projects/Short class tests/MCQ based quizzes/Projects/Presentations/Group 
discussions/ Attendance with 20 % of total marks assigned to the subject. 
One End Semester Examination (Major Examination) with 50% of total marks assigned to the subject.  
It is compulsory to appear in End Semester Examination and secure at least 20% marks of total End 
semester exam marks. 
If a candidate secures less than 20% marks of total End semester exam marks, he/she will be awarded 
F grade.  
 
 
4.2 Method for the Award of Grades: 
 
For the award of grades in a course, all component wise evaluation shall be done in terms of marks. 
The components include: Midterm-1 and Midterm-2 examinations, Assignments/projects/class 
presentations/Attendance, and   End semester examination as per regulation 4.1. After converting the 
marks obtained in percentage , the grades will be assigned as per the guidelines given below :

Evaluation of Performance  
 
5.1 
The performance of a student shall be evaluated in terms of two indices, viz. Semester Grade 
Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). 
SGPA is the grade point average for the semester, and CGPA is the cumulative grade point average 
for all the completed semesters at any point in time. 
The earned credits (E.C) are defined as the sum of course credits for course in which A+ to D grade 
has been obtained. For U.G students (B.E), credits from courses in which NP or S grade has been 
obtained are also added.\n\nBE-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SCHEME & SYLLABUS Batch 2021-25                          6 | P a g e
